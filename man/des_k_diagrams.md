"There are basically two main types of K-diagrams (Fig. 9). Type 1 can be considered as “classical”, as it occurs when tempera- ture courses form a daily loop, with the dTsym /dTas ratio gradually increasing from the morning to the afternoon and then de- creasing until nightfall (Fig. 9a). Type 2 is responsible for the so-called “McDonalds effect”, with the dTsym /dTas ratio gradually increasing in the morning, suddenly “turns back” at midday, then increasing again in the afternoon before finally decreasing at night (Fig. 9b). The difference between the two types of K-diagrams relates directly to the different mutual position of dTsym and dTas under higher flow rate conditions. When flow rates are low, dTas is always higher than dTsym. Once both temperature gradients are equalized (easily character- ized by dTs-a as equal to zero and when dTsym/dTas ratio equals to 1), dTas could be ei- ther lower than dTsym (type 1) or higher (type 2)."
