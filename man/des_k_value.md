The K value is the absolute value of the temperature difference at zero sap flow and is used to calculate sap flow based on recorded temperature measurements.
In zero flow conditions, K-values can be easily determined as intersection of dTas or dTs-a with Y axis of a K-diagram. In the case of no zero flow conditions, the K-value can be extrapolated.
