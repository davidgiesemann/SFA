The Sap Flow Analyzer (SFA) is an R Shiny app to process sap flow data recorded with HFD (Heat Field Defomation) sensors. The app allows to clean the data, determine the k-value, calculate the sap flow index and sap flow density and estimate sap flow rates and tree water use if tree properties are given. 

A _default_ data set is stored in the app, which contains raw temperature data of approx. 24 h. The measurements were performed on a guava tree in Mexico in 03/2020.
