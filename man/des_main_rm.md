# Sap Flow analyser

The Sap Flow analyser is an R Shiny app to process sap flow data recorded with HFD (Heat Field Defomations) sensors. The app allows to clean the data, determine the k-value, calculate the sap flow index and sap flow density and estimate sap flow rates and tree water use if tree properties are given.
