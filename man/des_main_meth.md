The Heat Field Deformation (HFD) method is a thermodynamic method to measure sap flow (Nadezhdina, 2018). With a needle-like heater a heat field is created and the heat distribution is measured with three needle-linke sensors. Based on the ratio of temperature gradients around the heater in axial (T<sub>Sym</sub>) and tangential (T<sub>a-s</sub>) directions sap flow density can be calculated.
